# Human volunteer rotabiome study

63 healthy volunteers were enrolled to test how antibiotic pre-treatment altered vaccine efficacy.

## Cohort Break down:

* 21 Control patients
* 21 Patients treated with vancomycin
* 21 Pateinets treated with Vancomycin, Ciprofloxacin and metronidazole

Antibiotics were provided from 3 to 9 days prior to vaccination with the following vaccines:

* Pneumo 23
* Rotarix
* Tetanus

Vaccination outcome was determined by a combination of fecal and serum antibody tests at periods for 28 days. Stool was collected at Day -9 (antibiotic initiation), Day 0 (vaccine administration) and Day 7 (post-vaccination) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Samples were demultiplexed and preprocessed with dada2 to extract amplicon sequence varaints (ASVs). ASVs were analyzed using R with heavy reliance on PhyloSeq.
